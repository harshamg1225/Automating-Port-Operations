Project Statement:
Marina Pier Inc. is leveraging technology to automate their operations on the San Francisco port.
The company’s management has set out to build a bias-free/ corruption-free automatic system that reports & avoids faulty situations caused by human error. Examples of human error include misclassifying the correct type of boat. The type of boat that enters the port region is as follows.
●	Buoy
●	Cruise_ship
●	Ferry_boat
●	Freight_boar
●	Gondola
●	Inflatable_boat
●	Kayak
●	Paper_boat
●	Sailboat
Marina Pier wants to use Deep Learning techniques to build an automatic reporting system that recognizes the boat. The company is also looking to use a transfer learning approach of any lightweight pre-trained model in order to deploy in mobile devices.
